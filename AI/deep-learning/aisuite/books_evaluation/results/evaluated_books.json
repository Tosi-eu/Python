        "summary": "In One Economics, Many Recipes , leading economist Dani Rodrik argues that neither globalizers nor antiglobalizers have got it right. While economic globalization can be a boon for countries that are trying to dig out of poverty, success usually requires following policies that are tailored to local economic and political realities rather than obeying the dictates of the international globalization establishment. A definitive statement of Rodrik's original and influential perspective on economic growth and globalization, One Economics, Many Recipes shows how successful countries craft their own unique strategies--and what other countries can learn from them.\n\n\nTo most proglobalizers, globalization is a source of economic salvation for developing nations, and to fully benefit from it nations must follow a universal set of rules designed by organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization and enforced by international investors and capital markets. But to most antiglobalizers, such global rules spell nothing but trouble, and the more poor nations shield themselves from them, the better off they are. Rodrik rejects the simplifications of both sides, showing that poor countries get rich not by copying what Washington technocrats preach or what others have done, but by overcoming their own highly specific constraints. And, far from conflicting with economic science, this is exactly what good economics teaches.",

This nuanced approach is supported by Rodrik's expertise in economics and his analysis of successful countries' unique strategies. By highlighting the need for countries to overcome their own specific constraints, Rodrik provides a refreshing and thought-provoking perspective on economic development.\n\nOverall, \"One Economics, Many Recipes\" is a well-researched and compelling read that offers valuable insights for anyone interested in international development, economic policy, or globalization. It is a good purchase for those looking to expand their understanding of these complex issues and consider alternative viewpoints in the field of economics."

In the last 25 years of his life his explorations increased—especially in shorter forms and one-act plays—as Williams created performance pieces with elements of theater of the absurd, theater of cruelty, theater of the ridiculous, as well as motifs from Japanese forms such as Noh and Kabuki, high camp and satire, and with innovative visual and verbal styles that were entirely his own.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by Beckett, Genet, and Pinter, among others, Williams worked hard to expand the boundaries of the lyric realism he was best known for. These plays were explicitly intended to be performed off-off Broadway or regionally. Sometimes disturbing, sometimes outrageous, quite often the tone of these plays is rough, bawdy or even cartoonish. While a number of these plays employ what could be termed bizarre \"happy endings,\" others gaze unblinkingly into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThough several of Williams' lesser-known works from this period have already been published by New Directions, these twelve plays have never been collected. Most of these shorter plays are unknown to audiences and scholars—some are published here for the first time—yet all of them embrace, in one way or another, what Time magazine called \"the four major concerns that have spurred Williams' dramatic imagination: loneliness, love, the violated heart and the valiancy of survival.\"",

Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise.

Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile—physical or spiritual—but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing.\r\n\r\nProfoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core.
